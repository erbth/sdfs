# Sequential Data FileSystem (sdfs)

A simple distributed filesystem for sequential data.

libsdfs_ds:  block data storage client library
libsdfs_fs:  filesystem client library; builds on top of libsdfs-ds

sdfs-ds:     Simple block IO client
sdfs-mkfs:   Format a sdfs storage for use as filesystem (or display information
             about it)
sdfs-fuse:   fuse filesystem client

Restrictions:
  * Parallel unaligned writes can overwrite each other (race condition on the
	unaltered bytes)

  * Optimized for sequential reads; writes are (probably) slower

  * The filesystem does not implement locking. Hence parallel writes and reads
	can overlap each other and produce corrupt data, including corrupting the
	filesystem
