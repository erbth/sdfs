Sequential Data FileSystem

A simple distributed filesystem for sequential data.

libsdfs_ds:  block data storage client library
libsdfs_fs:  filesystem client library; builds on top of libsdfs-ds

Restrictions:
  * parallel unaligned writes can overwrite each other (race condition on the
	unaltered bytes)

  * optimized for sequential reads; writes are (probably) slower
